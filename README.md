AngWolf Wolfenstein-3D Level Generator

This is the Angdoom level generator from http://interreality.org/~tetron/technology/angdoom/, retooled to produce Wolfenstein-3D levels and setup as a CMake project with some altered defines
to be MSVC compatible as well as removing the need for the GGI library.

USAGE (from a GUI/file explorer)

Double-click angdoom or angdoom.exe

USAGE (from a terminal/command prompt)

> ./angwolf

or

> angwolf.exe

This will produce a GAMEMAPS.WL6 and MAPHEAD.WL6 file in the same directory. At this time, there are no command-line options. BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL .WL6 FILES BEFORE USING THE OUTPUT FROM THIS PROGRAM!
